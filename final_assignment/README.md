Learning a new language has never been easier with the Flashcard Frenzy Application! This application generates flashcards based on the user's desired target language, organizes flashcards according to user selections, and allows users to view all of their flashcards in one window!

Each flashcard will display the word's target translation on the front. Each card is color coded based on the target language. 

# Usage 
## Creating a New Flashcard:
Simply select your target language from one of the drop down languages, type the word in English that you'd like to translate, add a category for the sorting function, and click add.

Once the flashcard is created you will be able to view all of your flashcards in your flashcard set window.

## Studying your Flashcards:
If you would like to review what the word means in English, simply click on the card. After you have viewed the meaning, simply click the card again to display the target language.

## Filtering your Flashcards:

The filtering options allow you to display only the flashcards you'd like to study. Simply go to the top right of the window, click on the settings icon and it will present the filter options.
If you'd like to filter by language, you can select the language button for your target language.
You can further filter it by going to the categories section and selecting the category you would like to focus on.

If you did not enter a category when creating your flashcard, there will be no categories available in the category selection box. Please be sure to enter a category when creating a flashcard if you'd like to filter them!

If you do not select a language from the filter options, but select a category, it will display flashcards of all languages that are within the selected category.

If you would like to clear the filter, you can hit the red reset button.

## Deleting Flashcards:
